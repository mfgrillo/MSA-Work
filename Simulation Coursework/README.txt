This showcases work performed for a simulation course. It had a heavy focus on, of course, data simulation, as well as topics surrounding it in statistics, probability, calculus and algebra.

Each folder corresponds to a homework assignment. Not all questions were related to python, but those that are have an associated notebook. 
There is a pdf containing the questions and a separate pdf containing my solutions.

Several tasks utilize Simio, a simulation software. These files have been omitted due to lack of relevance, but I can provide them upon request!
